# R-Project-Wrangling-and-Visualizing-Musical-Data

In this project, using datasets from a sample of pop/rock music from the 1950s-1990s, I identified the most common chords and chord progressions and compared the styles of different artists. Using the R-packages readr and dplyr, I imported and manipulated data. 

After "wrangling" the data, I created the following visualizations:  a) a flipped bar plot that shows the 20 most common chord bigrams, b) a faceted plot that shows the frequency of the most common chords side-by-side for songs by piano- and guitar-driven artists, and c) a faceted plot that shows the frequency of the most common chord bigrams side-by-side for songs by piano- and guitar-driven artists.

This project allowed me to apply skills from several DataCamp courses, including counting the number of occurrences by using the count function, creating new columns by using the mutate function, removing duplicates by using the unique function, and visualizing bar and faceted plots with ggplot2.
